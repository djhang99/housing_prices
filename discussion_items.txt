Hugh Questions?

1. Should not be taking log of price for tree based models in the initiate data function

2. Should we be scaling the data in the tree based models?

3. Make sure removing outliers gets incorporated in the cleaning file

4. Need to set random seed on the train test split, right now my results are varying each time I import data
