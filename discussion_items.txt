Hugh Questions?

1. Used MinMaxScaler to scale numeric data, since we have a high amount of 0 values
  I don't think a gaussian distribution can be assumed. Therefore, should not Used
  StandardScaler()

2. Year/Month sold to be categorical(only 4 options). Year built and remodeled to be Numeric
  (100 year range)?

3. How to handle null values for Lot Frontage?

4. Create functions for cleaning, dummifying, and scaling? Or just export csv's with clean data to use

5. Split up features (EDA) and ML model types among 4 us to streamline work?

6. Latest data is for year 2010, if we are doing a predictive model should we assume that we are predicting
for 2010/2011. Do we need to inflation adjust sale price data based on date of sale?

7. Which file do we want to train test split in? Use KFold for validation of models?
