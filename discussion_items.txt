Hugh Questions?

1. Used MinMaxScaler to scale numeric data, since we have a high amount of 0 values
  I don't think a gaussian distribution can be assumed. Therefore, should not Used
  StandardScaler()


2. Latest data is for year 2010, if we are doing a predictive model should we assume that we are predicting
for 2010/2011. Do we need to inflation adjust sale price data based on date of sale?

3. Should y be a dateframe or array running into problems with tree models?

4. Use Mean Square Error as metric in all models? Cannot use the default R_squared in non_linear models
